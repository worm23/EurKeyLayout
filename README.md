# EurKeyLayout
Template for a EurKey based keyboard key caps from wasdkeyboard

# Layout
The keyboard layout is based on the EurKey layout from https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu

It's a variation of a US-Ansi keyboard with commonly used characters used in other European languages.

*WARNING* The following Layout is for a US-ANSI Keyboard, not a ISO Layout that is usually used in European countries like the International English, GB or the DE keyboard.

The keyboard SVG itself is based on the SVG Layout from https://wasdkeyboards.com

Here are some Tutorials on editing the SVG Layout: https://support.wasdkeyboards.com/hc/en-us/sections/115002234888-SVG-Layout-Tutorials

# How to Use
I'v used it to order custom key caps from the wasdkeyboards shop. You just have to upload the svg file.
Keep in mind that the Text printed is white, if that doesn't work with your chosen color of key caps, you just have to change the text color in the SVG.

# *WARNING:* At the time of writing I've not yet received the custom key caps. So use at your own risk!
